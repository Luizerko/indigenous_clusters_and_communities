# Tainacan-Based Dataset

This page provides an overview of how we utilized the [Tainacan collection](https://tainacan.museudoindio.gov.br/) to build our dataset, which was later used for clustering and analysis.

## Dataset Creation Process

The first step in our workflow is data collection. We accomplish this through a two-stage process:

1. **Scraping the data:** A [Bash script](https://github.com/Luizerko/indigenous_clusters_and_communities/tree/main/tainacan_collection/scrapping_data.sh) is used to extract data from the Tainacan platform.

2. **Processing and structuring:** A [Python script](https://github.com/Luizerko/indigenous_clusters_and_communities/tree/main/tainacan_collection/creating_dataset.py) then processes the raw data and organizes it into a structured CSV format.

Once the dataset is prepared, we proceed with **data cleaning and exploratory analysis** to assess the volume and distribution of the data, identify key categories and their relationships and explore potential clustering opportunities. For a more in-depth analysis of the dataset, refer to the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Luizerko/indigenous_clusters_and_communities/tree/main/tainacan_collection/dataset_exploration.ipynb).

Below, we provide a high-level summary of the dataset attributes, based on our initial inspection and documentation efforts.

## Data Processing

While many analyses were conducted during dataset assembly, additional preprocessing is required to prepare the data for clustering. Beyond handling inconsistencies such as formatting issues, missing data, and incorrect data structures, we focus on two key preprocessing steps crucial for clustering both images and text: **background removal for images** and **text normalization**.

### Image Background Removal

Although the collection's metadata contains some formatting inconsistencies, the images themselves are generally high-quality and well-processed. The problem, however, lies mostly on the consistency of the backgrounds. If they are not removed, the fine-tuned image extractors might group images based on background characteristics rather than object features, leading to misleading results.

To mitigate this issue, we made use of a state-of-the-art [open-source background removal pipeline](https://huggingface.co/briaai/RMBG-2.0). This solution includes built-in preprocessing, ensuring images are numerically normalized to have consistent size before background removal. Below are examples of the pipeline applied to our collection - images are mapped back to their original sizes before plotting:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/vase_br.jpg" alt="Original vase image." width="30%" style="margin: 5px;" />
  <img src="assets/vase_br_r.png" alt="Background removed vase image." width="30%" style="margin: 5px;" />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/bracelet_br.jpg" alt="Original bracelet image." width="30%" style="margin: 5px;" />
  <img src="assets/bracelet_br_r.png" alt="Background removed bracelet image." width="30%" style="margin: 5px;" />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/fiber_br.jpg" alt="Original fiber image." width="30%" style="margin: 5px;" />
  <img src="assets/fiber_br_r.png" alt="Background removed fiber image." width="30%" style="margin: 5px;" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  The top row presents a simple example featuring a vase - a single, well-defined object. The middle row, in turn, demonstrates background removal for multiple objects, while the bottom row showcases an object with a very complex (not well-defined) form. These examples illustrate both the variety of objects in the collection and the effectiveness of the background removal pipeline.
