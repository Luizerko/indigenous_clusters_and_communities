# Initiative for Indigenous Cultural Preservation in Brazil: a Study of Clusters and Communities

This is the base folder for the Indigenous Project. In here, you'll find the [install documentation](https://github.com/Luizerko/master_thesis/tree/main/indigenous_project/INSTALL.md) to set up your own environment in order to run the code in this repo, as well as the folders related to the collections used for the project (only the [Tainacan collection](https://tainacan.museudoindio.gov.br/) for now), and some results.

I hope you have as much fun going through the repo as I had developing it all :grin:
