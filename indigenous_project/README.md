# Initiative for Indigenous Cultural Preservation in Brazil: a Study of Clusters and Communities

This is the base folder for the Indigenous Project. In here, you'll find the [install documentation](https://github.com/Luizerko/master_thesis/tree/main/indigenous_project/INSTALL.md) to set up your own environment in order to run the code in this repo, as well as the folders related to the collections used for the project (only the [Tainacan collection](https://tainacan.museudoindio.gov.br/) for now), the [dataset documentation](https://github.com/Luizerko/master_thesis/tree/main/indigenous_project/DATASET.md), the [clustering experiments documentation](https://github.com/Luizerko/master_thesis/tree/main/indigenous_project/CLUSTER.md), the [visualization tool documentation](https://github.com/Luizerko/master_thesis/tree/main/indigenous_project/VISUALIZATION.md), and a small video featuring some obtained results. If you want to take a look at the code itself, go into the [`tainacan_collection`](https://github.com/Luizerko/master_thesis/tree/main/indigenous_project/tainacan_collection) folder.

I hope you have as much fun going through the repo as I had developing it all :grin:
